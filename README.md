###RULES OF GPA CALCULATOR

Do not enter negative numbers, zero, decimals, or letters. Only positive numbers like five classes or more.
For the grades, enter  a decimal or whole number between 0.0 and 4.0, but do not enter values outside of the range.
Don't enter letters or symbols
1 is half of the semester and 2 is the second half. The program uses list slicing to calculate the GPA of the halves of the semester.
